# NodeEase

## Current Version: v2.1.0-rc2

The NodeEase project is an easy to use, fast and very user-friendly tool, designed to make it possible for anyone willing to setup, run, manage and monitor a Nym mixnode to be able to do so.  

The project is specially designed for people who are not tech-savvy but are willing to setup, run, manage and monitor a Nym mixnode. The project enables them to do all that succesfully without having the necessary skillsets required, hence the project consequently tends to bridge the gap in the technical skillsets required to setup, run, manage and monitor a Nym mixnode. This will in turn enhance the continous growth and development of the Nym project, community and ecosystem.

## PROJECT DEVELOPMENT STATUS  

The NodeEase project is currently running smoothly and efficiently, however, further development and documentation of the project is still ongoing. There are lots of awesome and very cool features like special monitoring, automatic upgrade etc that will be developed and implemented as soon as they are ready.
